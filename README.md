This project aims to visualise emission data retrieved by an API maintained in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). The underlying data stems from the Sentinel-5 Earth observation satellite. It uses spectrophotometry to estimate the concentration of four different emissions: carbonmonoxide, methane, ozone and nitrogendioxide. Due to the way the data is measured, the visualised data might be incomplete for certain areas and for certain time intervals.

More information about data collection and usages can be found on the Website of the API

I started this project to get a better understanding of the entire FrontEnd Stack and to have a learning process combined with a thematic area I personally am interested in. The Dashboard is made with React.js, the map itself is supplied by MapBox, the overlay of the map runs on DeckGL, the Graph is visualized through Graph.js and some of the functional buttons are styled with styled-components.

I personally would have liked to make the app responsive on multiple sizes and devices, but I had to avoid falling into the "it's not done yet"-pitfall and eventually decided, that besiedes all it's possible improvements, I will finish it, once I get to all the functionality that I originally set out to implement.
